## ‚ú® What‚Äôs New in v0.1.7

This release introduces new features for reliability, automated workflows, and comprehensive new documentation to guide developers.

### üßæ New Features & Workflows
- **Checksum Feature:** Added checksum validation for `TopicId`, `ContractId`, and `ScheduleId` for more reliable operations.
- **Dependabot Workflow:** Added a `dependabot.yml` file to enable automated dependency management.
- **Example Runner Workflow:** Added a workflow for running example scripts, improving our CI pipeline.
- **Type Hints:** Added type hints to `setup_client()` and `create_new_account()` functions.
- **Initial Testing Guide:** Added a foundational testing guide to help new contributors.

### üìö New Documentation & Docstrings
- **Rebasing and Signing Guide:** New documentation on `md.signing` with instructions for maintaining commit verification.
- **New Examples:** Added `account_id.py` demonstrating `AccountId` usage (parsing, string compares, etc.).
- **Changelog Guides:** Added guides for resolving changelog conflicts and for SDK contributors to create proper entries.
- **Google-style Docstrings:** Added comprehensive Google-style docstrings for:
  - `CustomFractionalFee`
  - `CustomRoyaltyFee`
  - `AbstractTokenTransferTransaction`

## üîÑ Improvements & Changes
We've refactored several key areas to improve modularity, readability, and consistency across the codebase.

- **`TopicId` Refactor:** Refactored the `TopicId` class to use `DataClass` decorator, reducing boilerplate code.
- **Example Refactors:**
  - `topic_create.py`: Made more modular for better readability and reuse.
  - `transfer_hbar.py`: Improved modularity by separating transfer and balance query operations.
  - `file_append.py`: Modularized into `setup_client`, `create_file`, and `append_to_file` functions.
  - `token_create_nft_infinite.py`: Converted into modular functions.
- **Internal Refactors:**
  - Removed deprecated `snake_case` aliases.
  - Refactored `type_id` logic with a `dataclass` decorator for better maintainability.

---

## üêû Fixes
- Fixed a **code scanning alert** (no. 4) where workflow docs did not contain permissions.
- Fixed **broken Discord links** with stable Hyperledger/Hedera invites.
- Fixed **type hints** for topic-related transactions.
